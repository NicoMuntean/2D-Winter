# 2D-Winter

## Overview

The *2D-Winter* project is a vanilla Java developed early version of a [Terraria inspired](https://terraria.org) sandbox builder making use of procederal map generation. The goal of the project is to create an immersice 2D survival sandbox experience, with changing season the player has to adapt to, the climax being the winter, hence the projects name. As of now, core mechanics like player physics, map generation, stratified tile classes as well as a building and breaking mechanic have been implemented to create a first working demo.

## Map Generation
The application employs the ***[2D-Diamond-quare algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diamond-square_algorithm)*** to procederaly generate the map, resulting in randomly generated tile layouts.
